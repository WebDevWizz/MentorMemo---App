# MentorMemo--App
MentorMemo helps mentors to remain organized and to track their students.

This app can help some types of teachers/mentors who want to remember their students (possibly organized in teams) by providing a list and detailed information about them. 


# FUTURE IMPLEMENTATIONS: 

1. A button that allows you to add a new team
2. Allow you to modify the information for each student
3. Allow mentors to add additional information to each student's profile.
